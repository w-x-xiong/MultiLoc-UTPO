WLS_XWu_2.m reproduces the two-stage weighted linear least squares method proposed in 
X. Wu, Y. Liu, X. Zhu, and L. Mo, ``Efficient solutions for MIMO radar localization under unknown transmitter positions and offsets,'' \textit{IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun.}, vol. 21, no. 1, pp. 505--518, Jan. 2022.

SDP_UTPO.m reproduces the semidefinite programming method proposed in 
J. Pei, G. Wang, K. C. Ho, and L. Huang, ``Bias reduced semidefinite relaxation method for multistatic localization in the absence of transmitter position and its synchronization,'' in \textit{Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Acoust., Speech Signal Process. (ICASSP)}, Rhodes Island, Greece, Jun. 2023.

For technical details of the methods, please refer to the original authorsâ€”since I am merely reproducing their worksðŸ˜„

PEP_BMM_2.m is our approach proposed in
G. Cheng and W. Xiong, ``An iterative approach to multistatic localization with unknown transmitter position and offset,'' submitted to \textit{IEEE Signal Process. Lett.}, 2025.
